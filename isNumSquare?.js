// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that
// is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that
// in dynamic typed languages.

// To find the square root of a number in JavaScript, you can use
// the built-in Math.sqrt() method. Its syntax is:

// Math.sqrt(number);
// Here, the Math.sqrt() method takes a number and returns its square root.
