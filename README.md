# practice-makes-perfect

## Katas, practice and interview questions in the pursuit of cracking the software dev role, also because I love the thrill of solving a puzzle :closed_lock_with_key:

I have answered some of these in multiple ways, some almost complete, some need more work. As there are a million ways to solve a problem there is never an ultimate solution. :key: Often in Codewars there are simple one liners ( that are way beyond my capabilities) but they go against all coding practice standards of making human readable code ( or at least I tell myself that to feel better!)

I find I learn the most discovering different answers to the same questions so if you have any feedback or input please get in touch. Explanations and advice is very welcomed :pencil:
